# Look Here

Working like normal progammers here

Project and lab directories are split into each person for ease of access

So commits and pushes dont get ugly:

-make sure when you edit your files, work on the server or in another directory other than the repo, that
 way when you pull it wont be a nightmare if someone else made changes to their files.

-when you are ready to push simply overwrite your files in the repo directory, AFTER PULLING AND CHECKING GIT
 STATUS, then add -A, commit -m "message text", and push

Have a nice day and good luck on some jolly cooperation!
